## Pygame prototype template

I created this repo to save myself the trouble of re-writing this boilerplate over and over when I want to whip something quick up in Pygame.

If you're looking for a Pygame project skeleton that you can use for your next sandbox Baseball MMORPG, have a look at https://github.com/Mekire/pygame-mutiscene-template-with-movie. It scales better than this project does and has more useful features.

If you just want to use Pygame to accomplish a short task like writing a quick physics simulation or just generally prototyping any kind of concept that requires use of SDL, you can basically clone this repo and start coding.  


### Installation/Requirements
When installing Pygame with pip, I always have to do:  
`pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame`
